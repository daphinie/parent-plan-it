# parent-plan-it

####What it does
“ParentPlanIt” is an app to help single-parents budget to their goals for themselves and their children with the right resources and goal saving tracker.

####Inspiration
Single-parent families are commonly at higher financial risk compared to two-parent families which can impact their mental and physical health and wellbeing (Stack et Meredith, 2018). This project recognizes the unique challenges faced by single parents when it comes to managing their finances, such as balancing the demands of raising a child on a single income, planning for their child's education, and navigating the complex financial landscape. By providing personalized resources and tools, this project aims to help single parents achieve greater financial stability and independence, enabling them to better plan for their future and that of their children. One of the main help this project also aims to do is to educate single parents on the various resources available to them that can contribute to their financial income, such as government programs, grants, and other financial assistance programs. By empowering single parents with knowledge and resources, this project can help them overcome financial challenges and achieve their financial goals.
